# RosettaBot

A polyglot Slack bot.

_Prototype. Instructions on the way..._

Bot commands are mapped to RPC endpoints registered inside a WAMP Router. WAMP components can be written in multiple languages including:

* C++
* C#
* Elixir
* Erlang
* Go
* Haskell
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* Objective-C
* PHP
* Python

Registering WAMP components inside the dedicated router for our bot gives us an effective way to extend it's functionality using any listed programming language above.
